This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

 **Project Name:**  
**Front-End Assessment**  

**Work Description:**  

The project was successfully completed using the following modern technologies:  
- **Next.js 15** for dynamic application development  
- **TypeScript** for robust and precise coding  
- **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadeCn** for creating a high-quality, fully responsive user interface across all devices  

Initially, I conducted research on both regional and international trends to gain a deeper understanding of design and visual identity requirements, aiming to deliver exceptional work that aligns with expectations. Following this, I designed the initial layout using **Figma**, where I crafted all user interface elements and also designed the project's logo to enhance its visual identity.  

Upon completing the design phase, I moved on to development, adhering to best coding practices and leveraging a component-based structure to eliminate redundancy and streamline maintenance. I also added several sections that were not initially included in the task requirements, in an effort to improve the overall user experience and add extra value to the project.  

The design was carefully optimized to be fully responsive across all devices, and I ensured optimal performance through comprehensive testing to guarantee the reliability of all project components.  

Within the given timeframe, I successfully completed all required tasks while also incorporating meaningful enhancements. I hope my work meets your expectations. I am eager for the opportunity to join your esteemed company, where I can contribute my expertise, collaborate closely with your team, and benefit from the collective knowledge within your organization.  

I am confident that my ability to quickly learn and adapt will enable me to add substantial value to the team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
